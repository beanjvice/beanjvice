# Hi, I'm Arisa. ðŸ¦¦
Thinker by heart, developer by choice. 

## ðŸ©¶ About Me.
Hello! I'm a sophomore majoring in Computer Science at CUNY City Tech, based in NYC. I have a strong interest in full-stack software engineering and am known for being diligent in developing people-focused technology. Right now, I'm studying C++ and expanding my skills through hands-on projects and looking to further develop my skills in backend development.
